# Trov Subreddit Application

## Installation

## Technology used

### React
I started this project based on my own personal react starter kit, which itself is based off of [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  I use this approach primarily to handle the burden of managing build processes and configurations which it accomplishes by abstracting a lot of the heavy lifting into a package called [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts).

### Redux

### CSS

### Testing
For unit testing, I just [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/), which comes bundled with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
